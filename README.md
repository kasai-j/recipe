# recipe

I have completed the task as described:

Project
A recipe finder app using the RecipePuppy API: http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/

Requirements
● As the user types in a search query for the name of a recipe, search results should be
displayed in a list (i.e. each time the user adds or removes a character to the search
term, the list may update)
● Only the first 20 results of a search are displayed
● Must run on a Nexus 5X API 25 virtual device

 
 Please note: I did not have an opportunity in the hour to create Unit tests. Or complete refactoring, I would have liked to have moved
 code out of the Activity.
